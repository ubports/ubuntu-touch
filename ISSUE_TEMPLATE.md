Thank you for wanting to file an issue! If you have a minute, please take the time to read our guide on writing a good bug-report:

    https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/contribute/bugreporting.html

If not and you just want to get this over with, that's also quite alright. But please try to format your issue correctly, to make it easier for us to read. Below, we provide a template for a feature-request and a bug-report. Use common sense to determine what category your issue falls under and delete the template you don't need. Also, you don't need to stick to the templates under all circumstances. If you don't need a heading, remove it. If you think a new section will provide valuable information, add a new heading. We're not dogmatists, we're pragmatists who just want to be able to efficiently work with new issues.
